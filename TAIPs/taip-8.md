## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the TAIP.-->

Provides a simple and secure method for transaction agents to share verified
credentials identifying themselves or transaction parties to help comply with
their policies.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

Transaction Agents may have a requirement to identify specific aspects of
another Transaction Participant before they can Authorize or Settle transactions
according to the [Transaction Authorization Flow][TAIP-4]. They present these as
[TAIP-7 Agent Policies][TAIP-7]. This provides a simple method to securely share
required information as [Verified Presentations][VP] over End-to-End encrypted
[DIDComm].

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for TAIP. It should clearly explain why the state of the art is inadequate to address the problem that the TAIP solves. TAIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

There are strict regulatory requirements for exchanging PII of transaction
parties within the context of a transaction, such as complying with Sanctions
Name Screening requirements, FATF’s Travel Rule, and various international data
protection legislation.

Highlighting the identity of the parties and providing the data to the
transaction counterparties also improves UX, reduces the risk of fraud, and ties
transactions into business workflows such as payroll and e-commerce. Many other
Transaction Authorization Protocols, including [iso20022], and most Crypto
Travel Rule Protocols based on [IVMS-101] exchange transmit the PII in line with
the transfer request itself, which lends themselves to a significant risk of PII
exposure.

This is bad for end-users and can expose significant legal liability for
Transaction Agents handling this. The approach taken here is to remove any PII
from the core transaction meta-data that all agents require, and only exchange
the minimum required information directly between the specific Agents requiring
it. By allowing transaction agents to publish their policies up-front through
[TAIP-7], other agents can take a risk-based approach to comply with and
exchange the PII separately. It allows Agents to asses privacy policies,
regulations, etc, for the Agent requiring the PII before exchanging it.

## Specification

This specification is a simplified subset of the [PEx] and [WACIPEx]
specifications that are designed to request and present
[Verifiable Credentials][VC] between parties.

### Relation to Verifiable Credentials Model

In the context of the [W3C Verifiable Credential Model][VCModel] the following
parties are defined:

- **Subject** - An entity about which claims are made. In the context of
  [TAIP-4] this MUST be a [Party][TAIP-6] or [Agent][TAIP-5] to the transaction.
- **Issuer** - A role of an entity that asserts claims about the **Subject**
  into [VC]. In the context of [TAIP-4] this could be an [Agent][TAIP-5] to the
  transaction, but as portable KYC becomes more prevalent it doesn't have to be.
- **Verifier** - A role of an entity that requests and receives
  [Verifiable Presentations][VP] containing [Verifiable Credentials][VC] for a
  particular purpose. In the context of [TAIP-4] this MUST be an [Agent][TAIP-5]
  to the transaction.
- **Holder** - A role for an entity that holds a combination of
  [Verifiable Credentials][VC] and generate [Verifiable Presentations][VP] based
  on requests from **Verifiers**. In the context of [TAIP-4] this MUST be an
  [Agent][TAIP-5] to the transaction.

Within TAP the **Holder** and **Issuer** are often the same.

### `RequirePresentation` policy

Any [Agent][TAIP-5] to the Transaction can declare their requirements as a
`RequirePresentation` policy. See [TAIP-7] for more details.

This is a generic way of requesting a selected [Verifiable Presentation][VP]
from another agent in the transaction of a particular identity information
regarding a party or agent.

- `@type` - REQUIRED `RequirePresentation`
- `fromAgent` - REQUIRED Requesting presentation from an Agent representing the
  party in the transaction. Eg. `originator` or `beneficiary` in [TAIP-3]. In
  the context of the [VCModel] this Agent is the **Holder** of the Identity
  Claims.
- `about` - OPTIONAL Requesting presentation about a string or an array of
  [DID]s representing specific parties or agent in a transaction as the
  **Subject**.
- `aboutParty` - OPTIONAL Requesting presentation about a specific party in the
  transaction. Eg. `originator` or `beneficiary` in [TAIP-3] as the **Subject**.
- `aboutAgent` - OPTIONAL Requesting presentation about a specific Agent
  representing a party in the transaction. Eg. `originator` or `beneficiary` in
  [TAIP-3] as the **Subject**.
- `presentationDefinition` - REQUIRED a URL to a
  [Presentation Definition][PExDef] defining required information

### Present Proof

This is implemented as the
[WACI Present Proof](https://identity.foundation/waci-didcomm/#step-4-present-proof)
message.

- `type` - REQUIRED `https://didcomm.org/present-proof/3.0/presentation`
- `id` - REQUIRED. The message id, must be unique to the sender.
- `thid` - REQUIRED. Thread identifier. Uniquely identifies the transaction
  thread that the message belongs to.
- `from` - REQUIRED. The DID of the **Holder**
- `to` - REQUIRED. An array containing the DIDs of the recipients. This MUST
  only contain the DIDs of Agents who require this information
- `body` - REQUIRED. An empty object `{}`
- `attachments` - REQUIRED. An array containing at least one containing a
  [Verifable Presentation][VP] The message MUST be sent as
  [DIDComm Encrypted Messages](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.1/#didcomm-encrypted-messages).

## Rationale

It is intended for this model to be both support low latency transaction
authorization while at the same time minimizing the exposure of PII. It is also
designed to be built on existing emerging standards for secure identity
verification.

## Test Cases

Provide here any test cases that will help implementers of the TAIP to validate
their implementation.

### `RequirePresentation` examples

This example requests verified information about the `originator` party from the
Agent of the `originator`. The specific data requested is specified in [PExDef]:

```json
{
  "@type": "RequirePresentation",
  "@context": [
    "https://schema.org/Person",
    "https://www.gleif.org/ontology/Base/Entity"
  ],
  "fromAgent": "originator",
  "aboutParty": "originator",
  "presentationDefinition": "https://tap.rsvp/presentation-definitions/ivms-101/eu/tfr"
}
```

### Presentation Definition Test Case

The following is a presentation definition for an IVMS-101 name for a natural
person:

```json
{
  "presentation_definition": {
    "id": "32f54163-7166-48f1-93d8-ff217bdb0653",

              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "secondaryIdentifier",
        "name": "Given Name",
        "purpose": "To comply with FATF Travel Rule",
        "constraints": {

              "path": [
                "$.vc.credentialSubject.givenName"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ],
    "format": {
      "jwt": {
        "alg": ["EdDSA", "ES256K", "ES384"]
      },
      "jwt_vc": {

      },
      "jwt_vp": {
        "alg": ["EdDSA", "ES256K"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

<!--Please add an explicit list of intra-actor assumptions and known risk factors if applicable. Any normative definition of an interface requires these to be implementable; assumptions and risks should be at both individual interaction/use-case scale and systemically, should the interface specified gain ecosystem-namespace adoption. -->

The underlying technical security of this depends on the security of the
underlying [DID] model and [DIDComm] itself. It is intended to be used in an
adversarial world with untrusted participants.

Before exchanging any PII, you MUST trust this party enough to be able to share
that information. What is the legal purpose for sharing the information? Is this
the Agent you expect it to be?

When receiving any Presentation Proof, it is essential to perform the following:

- The **Verifier** MUST Verify the signature of the message
- The **Verifier** MUST Verify the signer of the DIDComm Message belongs to the
  DID of the Agent expected to Present the information to you.
- The **Verifier** MUST Verify the signer of the attached [VP] belongs to the
  DID of the Agent expected to Present the information to you.
- The **Verifier** MUST Verify the signer of the [VC] included in the attached
  [VP] belongs to the DID of the Agent expected to Present the information to
  you.

## Privacy Considerations

<!--Please add an explicit list of intra-actor assumptions and known risk factors if applicable. Any normative definition of an interface requires these to be implementable; assumptions and risks should be at both individual interaction/use-case scale and systemically, should the interface specified gain ecosystem-namespace adoption. -->

Privacy legislation, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and
the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), enforce well-established privacy
principles such as ‘Data Minimization’ and ‘Purpose Limitation.’

In analyzing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to comply with the
Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) travel rule requirements, each Agent must
only process the minimum amount of data required. TAIP-8 supports data
protection legislation by giving each Agent granular control over their PII
requests and provides travel rule creators with increased control to carefully
consider whether it’s safe to share PII with a counterparty.

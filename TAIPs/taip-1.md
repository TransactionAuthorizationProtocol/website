## Transaction Authorization Protocol (TAP) Rationale

Currently there is not a good abstract and chain agnostic method for multiple
parties to reason about and collaborate around blockchain transactions. As an
example, in a typical blockchain transaction the only party able to authorize a
transaction is the holder of a blockchain account. Smart contract based
applications can implement authorization functionality within their code, but
they do not work universally across different kinds of blockchains. As more and
more businesses and individuals work to utilize blockchains for real world
applications, it becomes increasingly important to be able to manage this. See
the [TAP Whitepaper] for more.

## What is an TAIP?

TAIP stands for Transaction Authorization Improvement Proposal and is designed
as a basic building block for specifying and implementing the Transaction
Authorization Protocol. A TAIP is a design document providing information to the
community or describing a standard to be used for transaction authorization
between multiple off-chain parties across multiple chains.

The TAIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a
rationale for it. The TAIP author is responsible for building consensus within
the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

## TAIP Rationale

Blockchain development is still under very rapid pace. Adding authorization
support to new technologies requires a decentralized approach to authoring this.

TAIPs allows authors to focus on specific aspects of authorization and
interactions with new protocols, technologies, and workflows.

## TAIP Formats and Templates

TAIPs should be written in [markdown][markdown] format. Image files should be
included in a subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that TAIP as follows:
`assets/taip-N` (where **N** is to be replaced with the TAIP number). When
linking to an image in the TAIP, use relative links such as
`../assets/taip-1/image.png`.

## TAIP Header Preamble

Each TAIP must begin with an [RFC 822] style header preamble, preceded and
followed by three hyphens (`---`). This header is also termed
["front matter" by Jekyll]. The headers must appear in the following order.
Headers marked with "*" are optional and are described below. All other headers
are required.

- `taip:` TAIP number (this is determined by the TAIP editor)
- `title:` TAIP title
- `author:` a list of the author's or authors' name(s) and/or username(s), or
  name(s) and email(s). Details are below.
- `discussions-to: *` URL pointing to the official discussion thread
- `status:` `Draft`, `Rejected`, `Review`, `Last Call`, `Withdrawn`, `Final`,
  `Superseded`
- `review-period-end: *` date review period ends
- `type:` `Standard`, `Informational`, `Meta`
- `created:` date created on
- `updated: *` comma separated list of dates
- `requires: *` TAIP number(s); if multiple, use `1, 2` format to create a YAML
  array
- `replaces: *` TAIP number(s); if multiple, use `1, 2` format to create a YAML
  array
- `superseded-by: *` TAIP number(s) or URL of non-TAIP standard

Headers that permit lists must separate elements with commas.

Headers requiring dates will always do so in the format of ISO 8601
(yyyy-mm-dd).

#### `author` header

The `author` header optionally lists the names, email addresses or usernames of
the authors/owners of the TAIP. Those who prefer anonymity may use a username
only, or a first name and a username. The format of the author header value must
be:

> Random J. User &lt;address@dom.ain&gt;

or

> Random J. User (@username)

if the email address or GitHub username is included, and

> Random J. User

if the email address is not given.

#### `resolution` header

#### `discussions-to` header

While a TAIP is a draft, a `discussions-to` header will indicate the mailing
list or URL where the TAIP is being discussed.

As a single exception, `discussions-to` cannot point to GitHub pull requests.

#### `type` header

The `type` header specifies the type of TAIP: Standard, Meta, or Informational.

#### `created` header

The `created` header records the date that the TAIP was assigned a number. Both
headers should be in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2001-08-14.

#### `updated` header

The `updated` header records the date(s) when the TAIP was updated with
"substantial" changes. This header is only valid for TAIPs of Draft and Active
status.

#### `requires` header

TAIPs may have a `requires` header, indicating the TAIP(s) on which this TAIP
depends. Note that if the TAIP requires multiple others, the value should be an
array of integers (no `"` needed) and/or URLs (wrapped in `"`s) within square
brackets (`[]`).

#### `superseded-by` and `replaces` headers

TAIPs may also have a `superseded-by` header indicating that a TAIP has been
rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the TAIP that
replaces the current document. The newer TAIP must have a `replaces` header
containing the number of the TAIP that it rendered obsolete.

## Auxiliary Files

TAIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Such files must be named
TAIP-XXXX-Y.ext, where “XXXX” is the TAIP number, “Y” is a serial number
(starting at 1), and “ext” is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g.
“png”).

## Design Principles of for TAIPs

- Follow the
  ~~[Robustness Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle)~~
  - _“be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
    others”_
- It should be message based and support peer 2 peer messaging
- It should support self-hosted wallets under the direct control of an ultimate
  party
- Avoid reliance on centralized gateways or associations to impose trust by
  utilizing Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for all parties and agents
  involved.
- Certain workflows such as the Travel Rule flow, should be able to be
  implemented even if one services to participates actively in the flow, but
  should encourage and help push more services to be active participants
- Any agent to the transaction should be able to initiate a transaction
- There is no strict message flow defined, but strict flows can be added through
  TAIPs
- To be able to support a transition for companies adopting it, it should be
  possible to create messages after the fact outlining the meta-data for an
  exiting crypto transaction
- Modern blockchain transactions often include multiple individual real world
  transactions, such as Bitcoin UTXO transactions or airdrop transactions.
  Several kinds of real world transactions are also implemented through multiple
  blockchain transactions such as multi-sigs and many kinds of transactions
  requiring pre-authorization. Thus transactions in TAP could have a many to
  many relationship with blockchain transactions.
- Separate out the exchange of sensitive PII information between agents to be
  fully end-to-end encrypted and handled through the messaging flow on a need to
  know policy based basis
- Allow each agent to be able to authorize or reject a transfer, while
  understanding that for blockchain transactions only the agent holding the keys
  ultimately authorizes a transaction
- Support discovery of relevant agents to the flow, by allowing each agent to be
  able to inject an intermediary agent
- Allow each agent to be able to replace themselves from the transaction with
  another DID, e.g. redirect the transaction to another legal entity or a
  custodial service provider
- Built primarily on existing open standards
  - Flexible message encoding default, but default to
    [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org)
  - Use [Chain Agnostic standards](https://chainagnostic.org) whenever possible
    for blockchain relevant standards, such as:
    - References to blockchain assets should rely on
      [CAIP-19](https://chainagnostic.org/CAIPs/caip-19)
    - References to blockchain accounts should rely on
      [CAIP-10](https://chainagnostic.org/CAIPs/caip-10)
  - Identifiers for parties should use
    [RFC-3987 IRIs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3987), but more
    specifically
    [W3C Decentralized Identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) (DIDs) are
    recommended
  - Identifiers for agents should use
    [W3C Decentralized Identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) (DIDs)

- References to agents or other services should also use DID’s, but prefer DID
  methods that can immediately be used to identify it. Eg.
  [PKH-DID](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md)
  methods for blockchain wallets or smart contracts and
  [Web DIDs](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/) for centralized services
- Messaging and Encryption should be based on proven digital signature and
  encryption standards:
  - [IETF RFC-7515 JWS](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515) for signed data
    between agents
  - [IETF RFC-7516 JWE](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7516.html) for
    encrypted data between agents
  - [DID-Comm V2](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/)
    semantics for decentralized messaging between services
- Allow anyone to build their own agent implementing the protocol

## Transferring TAIP Ownership

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of TAIPs to a new
champion. In general, we'd like to retain the original author as a co-author of
the transferred TAIP, but that's really up to the original author. A good reason
to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or
interest in updating it or following through with the TAIP process, or has
fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or isn't responding to
email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the
direction of the TAIP. We try to build consensus around a TAIP, but if that's
not possible, you can always submit a competing TAIP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a TAIP, send a message asking to
take over, addressed to both the original author and the TAIP editor. If the
original author doesn't respond to email in a timely manner, the TAIP editor
will make a unilateral decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed
:)).

## TAIP Editors

Temporarily [Notabene](https://notabene.id) will act as editors. Notabene
pledges to implement a simple informal governance structure during H1 2024 to
include more parties and lessent the reliance on a single company.

## TAIP Editorial Process

For each new TAIP that comes in, an editor does the following:

- Read the TAIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make
  technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to get to final status.
- The title should accurately describe the content.
- Check the TAIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.),
  markup (Github flavored Markdown), code style.

If the TAIP isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for
revision, with specific instructions.

Once the TAIP is ready for the repository, the TAIP editor will:

- Assign a TAIP number (generally the PR number or, if preferred by the author,
  the Issue # if there was discussion in the Issues section of this repository
  about this TAIP)

- Merge the corresponding pull request

- Send a message back to the TAIP author with the next step.

The editors don't pass judgment on TAIPs. We merely do the administrative &
editorial part.

## History

This document was derived heavily from [CAIP-1] written by Ligi, which was
derived by [Bitcoin's BIP-0001] written by Amir Taaki, which in turn was derived
from [Python's PEP-0001]. In many places text was simply copied and modified.
Although the PEP-0001 text was written by Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, and David
Goodger, they are not responsible for its use in Transaction Authorization
Improvement Proposals, and should not be bothered with technical questions
specific to TAIPs. Please direct all comments to the TAIP editors.

# Messaging

## Summary

TAIP-2 defines the messaging structure in the Transaction Authorization Protocol
(TAP)](<https://tap.rsvp>) that allows agents and parties identified through
Decentralized Identifiers ([DIDs][DID]) to securely communicate about a digital
asset transaction before settlement on a blockchain.

## Abstract

TAIP-2 sets up the primary method for agents identified by [DIDs][DID] to
communicate securely and privately directly with each other. At its core, it
uses [DIDComm Messaging][DIDComm] and sets up some minimum requirements for
DIDComm Messages utilized within the context of TAP.

## Motivation

The primary communication method on blockchains today is through public, shared,
and immutable transactions. To be able to authorize blockchain transactions,
parties, being end-users or businesses, may need to exchange sensitive private
information with each other.

## Specification

### Messaging Encoding

TAP messages MUST be encoded in [JSON] format.

### Messaging Methodology

TAP messages should adhere to the [DIDComm-V2 specification][DIDComm],
benefiting from its security, privacy, decentralization, and transport
independence.

The following attributes from DIDComm are used in TAP:

- `id` - REQUIRED. The message id, MUST be unique to the sender.
- `type` - REQUIRED. A URI that associates the `type` of message being sent in
  the body. A URI that associates the body of a plaintext message with a
  published and versioned schema. Core TAP Messages defined as part of TAIPs
  SHOULD be use an URI in the `https://tap.rsvp/taips/N` namespace.
- `from` - REQUIRED. The DID of the sender
- `to` - REQUIRED. An array containing the DIDs of the recipients
- `thid` - OPTIONAL. Thread identifier. Uniquely identifies the thread that the
  message belongs to. If not included, the id property of the message MUST be
  treated as the value of the thid.
- `pthid` - OPTIONAL. Parent thread identifier. If the message is a child of a
  thread the pthid will uniquely identify which thread is the parent.
- `body` - REQUIRED. The message body, which MUST contain a valid [JSON-LD]
  object.
- `created_time` - REQUIRED. The time the message was created.
- `expires_time` - OPTIONAL. The time the message expires. A recipient MUST
  ignore the message after this time.

### Message Signing

TAP messages MUST be signed using the [JSON Web Signature (JWS)][JWS] standard,
as specified in
[DIDComm Signed Messages](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.1/#message-signing).

#### Signing Algorithms

Message signing SHOULD use one of the following algorithms, that are commonly
used in blockchain applications today:

- EdDSA (with crv=Ed25519) - Elliptic curve digital signature with Edwards
  curves and SHA-512
- ES256K - Elliptic curve digital signature with Secp256k1 keys

#### Verification of a Signed Message

Public key resolution should be performed as specified in DIDComm by looking up
the messages `kid` in the senders
[DID Document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#authentication).

For illustrative purposes, this and other TAIPs will present
[Plaintext Messages](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.1/#plaintext-message-structure)

### Message Encryption

Certain types of messages can perform additional end-to-end encryption over
transport level encryption. When encrypted TAP messages MUST be encrypted
according to the [JSON Web Encryption (JWE)][JWE] standard, using methods
specified in
[DIDComm Encrypted Messages](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.1/#message-encryption).

See DIDComm specification for details on key resolution throught the senders and
recipients DID documents.

### Sending and Receiving messages

## Rationale

This TAIP is based on existing standards like JWE and JWS. It is designed to be
decentralized and tightly tied to decentralized identifies for each party
involved. While centralized services can actively play a part in TAP, it is
never a requirement.

- [JSON Web Encryption (JWE)][JWE] is a widely adopted method for representing
  encrypted JSON structures
- [JSON Web Signature (JWS)][JWS] is also widely adopted method for representing
  JSON structures secured with digital signatures
- [DIDComm Messaging][DIDComm] provides the semantics to enabled secure, private
  and decentralized messages between TAP participants.
- [JSON-LD] provides a well-adopted open standard for representing linked JSON
  structures that pairs well with the [TAP](https://tap.rspv) decentralized
  messaging standard.

## Test Cases

The following shows a minimal example of a valid DIDComm Plaintext Message
following DIDComm spec.

```json
{
  "id": "abcdefg",
  "type": "https://tap.rvsp/messages/example",
  "from": "did:example:alice",
  "to": ["did:example:bob"],
  "created_time": 1516269022,
  "expires_time": 1516385931,
  "body": {
    "@context": "https://tap.rvsp/messages/example"
    /* ... TAP message body */
  }
}
```

## Security Concerns

DIDComm builds on established standards for message signing and encryption. The
security of it depends primarily on the security of the underlying DID methods
used to identify participants and key resolution used.

## Privacy Considerations

DIDComm is designed to handle sensitive data such as PII in a decentralized
context. When interacting with a party through their DID endpoint, the
underlying privacy depends on each party having implemented adequate data
security and privacy concerns.

Doing this evaluation is out of the scope of TAIP-2 and must be handled by each
participant in a TAIP-2 message. A future TAIP could be written to provide more
detailed guidelines on this.

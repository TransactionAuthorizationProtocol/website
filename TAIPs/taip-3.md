## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the TAIP.-->

This specification provides the messaging details for a simple virtual asset
transfer between two parties as part of a Transaction Authorization Protocol
flow.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

This TAIP contains a specification for a metadata message about a virtual asset
transaction for use as part of the Authorization Flow in TAP.

The primary type of transaction this defines supports the transfer of an amount
of a fungible or non-fungible token from an originator to a beneficiary.

This TAIP only specifies the specifics of a Transfer rather than the complete
Authorization Flow, as defined in [TAIP-4].

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for TAIP. It should clearly explain why the state of the art is inadequate to address the problem that the TAIP solves. TAIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The Asset Transfer is a simple chain-agnostic representation of a typical
virtual asset transaction and its parties. The vast majority of transactions
performed by both custodial services and self-hosted wallets fall under this
classification.

This specification builds on existing [Chain Agnostic standards][ChainAgnostic]
such as [CAIP-10 Account Identifiers][CAIP-10] and
[CAIP-19 Asset Identifiers][CAIP-19].

For developers of new blockchain protocols and token standards, make sure that
you implement these and list them on the
[Chainagnostic Namespaces](https://namespaces.chainagnostic.org) page for
reference.

## Specification

<!--The technical specification should describe the standard in detail. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations. -->

Asset Transfers are implemented in the body of a [TAIP-2] message.

### DIDComm type URI

The preliminary URI to be used in the [TAIP-2] type header should be
`https://tap.rsvp/schema/taip-3#Transfer`.

### Message Body

As specified in [TAIP-2] the message body is [JSON-LD]. The following attributes
are defined:

- `@context` - REQUIRED the JSON-LD context `https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0`
  (provisional)
- `@type` - REQUIRED the JSON-LD type `https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer`
  (provisional)
- `asset` - REQUIRED the [CAIP-19](CAIP-19) identifier of the asset
- `amountSubunits` - OPTIONAL for NFTs and REQUIRED for fungible tokens.
  Specified as a string with the full amount in integer in the smallest subunit
  of a token
- `originator` - OPTIONAL an object representing the originating (aka the
  sender) party (see [TAIP-6](TAIP-6))
- `beneficiary` - OPTIONAL an object representing the beneficiary (aka the
  recipient) party (see [TAIP-6](TAIP-6))
- `settlementId` - OPTIONAL a
  [CAIP-220](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/221/files) identifier
  of the underlying settlement transaction on a blockchain. For more details see
  below.
- `agents` - REQUIRED an array of identity objects representing the agents who
  help execute the transaction. See [TAIP-5](TAIP-5) for more.

Many of the attributes are optional and through the process of authorization can
be expanded and modified collaboratively by the agents of a transaction.

#### Transfer Amounts

The amount of a transfer is specified as `amountSubunits` as it is the most
precise representation of an amount and is, in most cases, the same as used in
the underlying blockchain protocol. For many application developers, this can be
error-prone. It is the responsibility of library and tool developers to help
educate and help convert between commonly used decimal amounts and the
underlying sub-unit.

As an example `ETH 1.23` should be encoded as `1230000000000000000`.

#### `settlementId`

Use a simplified version of the format proposed by
[CAIP-220](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/221/files)

```
block_address:        chain_id + ":" [ + "block:"]? + "txn/" + transaction_id?
chain_id:             [-a-z0-9]{3,8}:[-_a-zA-Z0-9]{1,32} (See [CAIP-2][])
transaction_id:       [-%a-zA-Z0-9]{1,128}
```

eg:

```
eip155:1:tx/0x3edb98c24d46d148eb926c714f4fbaa117c47b0c0821f38bfce9763604457c33
```

### Agent Roles

[Agents][TAIP-5] can have specific roles vital to the execution of a
transaction.

The following two roles can be used as attributes on Agents listed in the agents
array:

- `SettlementAddress`, The blockchain wallet agent to settle a transaction to
- `SourceAddress` The blockchain wallet agent used to send the transaction from

Neither of these is required but can be used to specify the blockchain wallets
up front.

## Rationale

<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

This message type is designed to be as general and chain agnostic as possible
and compatible with as little meta-data as possible, together with any required
meta-data, that is useful for improving usability, safety, and record-keeping
for a transaction.

Note this is designed to be used as an initial request message. The body
attributes can be used as a representation of the internal state of a
transaction by an agent, but do intentionally not represent the shared state.

It is also not intended to cover more complex transaction use cases, such as
non-token transfer-related smart contract calls. This TAIP is encouraged to be
forked and modified to create similar requests for Swaps, lending, and other
everyday use cases.

## Test Cases

<!--Please add diverse test cases here if applicable. Any normative definition of an interface requires test cases to be implementable. -->

The following is a minimal request for a transfer of 1.23 ETH from a trading
firm to the ethereum wallet with the address
`0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb`:

```json
{

  "type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
  "id": "...",
  "to": ["did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb"],

    "originator": {
      "@id": "did:web:originator.sample"
    },
    "amountSubunits": "1230000000000000000",
    "agents": [
      {

      },
      {
        "@id": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb",
        "role": "settlementAddress"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The following is a request for a transfer of 1.23 ETH from a crypto exchange
from a customer to the ethereum wallet with the address
`0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb`:

```json
{
  "from": "did:web:originator.vasp",
  "type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
  "id": "...",
  "to": [
    "did:web:beneficiary.vasp",
    "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb"
  ],
  "body": {

    "asset": "eip155:1/slip44:60",
    "originator": {
      "@id": "did:eg:bob"
    },
    "amountSubunits": "1230000000000000000",
    "agents": [
      {
        "@id": "did:web:originator.vasp"
      },
      {
        "@id": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb",
        "role": "settlementAddress"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The following is a request for a transfer of 1.23 ETH from a crypto exchange
from a customer to a customer at another hosted wallet, which does not include
settlement information. This allows the parties negotiate settlement as part of
the authorization flow:

```json
{
  "from": "did:web:originator.vasp",
  "type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
  "id": "...",
  "to": [
    "did:web:beneficiary.vasp",
    "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb"
  ],
  "body": {
    "@context": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0",
    "@type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
    "asset": "eip155:1/slip44:60",
    "originator": {
      "@id": "did:eg:bob"
    },
    "beneficiary": {
      "@id": "sms:+15105550101"
    },
    "amountSubunits": "1230000000000000000",
    "agents": [
      {
        "@id": "did:web:originator.vasp"
      },
      {
        "@id": "did:web:beneficiary.vasp"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The following is an example of a reasonably complete transaction already
settled. An Agent could create these to backfill information about an already
settled transaction.

```json
{
  "from": "did:web:originator.vasp",
  "type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
  "id": "...",
  "to": [
    "did:web:beneficiary.vasp",
    "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb"
  ],
  "body": {
    "@context": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0",
    "@type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
    "originator": {
      "@id": "did:eg:bob"
    },
    "beneficiary": {
      "@id": "did:eg:alice"
    },
    "asset": "eip155:1/slip44:60",
    "amountSubunits": "1230000000000000000",
    "settlementId": "eip155:1:tx/0x3edb98c24d46d148eb926c714f4fbaa117c47b0c0821f38bfce9763604457c33",
    "agents": [
      {
        "@id": "did:web:originator.vasp"
      },
      {
        "@id": "did:beneficiary.vasp"
      },
      {
        "@id": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb",
        "role": "settlementAddress"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

<!--Please add an explicit list of intra-actor assumptions and known risk factors if applicable. Any normative definition of an interface requires these to be implementable; assumptions and risks should be at both individual interaction/use-case scale and systemically, should the interface specified gain ecosystem-namespace adoption. -->

It is essential to understand that this represents a request to perform a
transaction, and requires all parties to verify all information in it to
authorize and settle a transaction safely. The agents are responsible for
confirming this information, even post-settlement.

## Privacy Considerations

<!--Please add an explicit list of intra-actor assumptions and known risk factors if applicable. Any normative definition of an interface requires these to be implementable; assumptions and risks should be at both individual interaction/use-case scale and systemically, should the interface specified gain ecosystem-namespace adoption. -->

This message can contain PII about end-users. Agents must understand their
privacy duties under national law to safeguard their customers' PII. As part of
a [TAIP-4] authorization flow, agents SHOULD evaluate the data privacy of any
other agent before sharing PII with them.

Agents SHOULD minimize the use of end-user PII in this message, but it can be
encrypted to specific trusted parties or agents separately. See [TAIP-8] for
more.

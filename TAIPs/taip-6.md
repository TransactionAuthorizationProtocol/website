## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the TAIP.-->

Parties are the real-world entities involved with a transaction. It could be
either legal or natural persons. Parties can control Agents who are part of
performing a transaction but are distinct from, for example, a software wallet
they control.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

This specification defines how parties are represented in a
[Transaction Authorization Protocol Flow][TAIP-4] and their relationships with
one or more agents.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for TAIP. It should clearly explain why the state of the art is inadequate to address the problem that the TAIP solves. TAIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Blockchains often use blockchain addresses instead of the ultimate parties to a
transaction. They are missing the context required to tie a transaction into a
real-world use case, such as an e-commerce payment, payroll, or other
transactions requiring record keeping, legal recourse, and risk mitigation based
on real-world counterparties.

## Specification

### Representing Parties

Parties are identified using an [IRI] as the @id attribute in a [JSON-LD]
object. IRIs are the internationalized updated version of URIs that most people
know today. IRI’s typically used as identifiers today represent
[email addresses][MAILTO] and [phone numbers][SMS]. Modern
[Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)][DID], which allow users to create and manage
their own identities in a decentralized manner, are also recommended.

Parties represented in [TAIP-2] messages using a straightforward [JSON-LD] node
syntax with the following attributes

- `@id` - REQUIRED the [IRI] of the Party

```json
{
  "@id": "did:web:vasp.com"
}
```

#### Specifying additional information about a party

Additional details can be submitted within a party object, using [JSON-LD] to
add other meta-data. This MUST not be used to provide private verified
information about a natural person such as that obtained through a KYC process.
See the Privacy Considerations section below for more. This information can be
requested and exchanged using [TAIP-8 Selective Disclosure][TAIP-8].

As an example you could add information about the country of a party like this:

```json
{
  "@context": { "cc": "https://schema.org/addressCountry" },
  "@id": "did:eg:bob",
  "cc:addressCountry": "de"
}
```

Or add the
[LEI](https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei)
of an institution like this:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "lei": "https://schema.org/leiCode"
  },
  "@id": "did:web:sample.com",
  "lei:leiCode": "..."
}
```

Future TAIPs can add additional attributes to parties. Since it is JSON-LD, you
could add additional data from other contexts.

### Types of Parties

Each transaction type can specify different methods of naming the attribute used
to be semantically correct within the context of it's scope.

For example parties in a [TAIP-3] message consist of the following two
attributes in it's `body`:

- `originator` representing the originator (or sender) of the Asset Transfer
- `beneficiary` representing the beneficiary (or recipient) of the Asset
  Transfer

Future TAIPs can define additional types of parties. Examples.

- `issuer` of a real world asset
- `trustee`, `grantor`, `beneficiary` for a trust
- `buyer`, `seller` for a sales contract

### Agents for Parties

Any Agent can add a `for` attibute to their Agent object (see [TAIP-5]). This
specifies that the agent is an agent for the [DID] or [IRI] for a particular
party.

Any Agent can send one of the following messages:

- `UpdateParty` - Adds one or updates a party to a transaction

#### UpdateParty

Any agent can update a party to a transaction by replying as a thread to the
initial message. The following shows the attributes of the `body` object:

- `@context` - REQUIRED the JSON-LD context `https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0`
  (provisional)
- `@type` - REQUIRED the JSON-LD type `https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#UpdateParty`
  (provisional)
- `partyType` - REQUIRED a string indicating the type of party to be updated.
  Eg. for [TAIP-3] this could be `originator` or `beneficiary`
- `party` - REQUIRED a Party Object to be added to the transaction.

If an existing transaction party is already included in the transaction an Agent
SHOULD update their internal record for this party with any additional data
provided in this message.

## Rationale

TODO

## Test Cases

Provide here any test cases that will help implementers of the TAIP to validate
their implementation.

### TAIP-3 Asset Transfers

#### Missing Beneficiary Information

See the following [TAIP-3] message outlining a typical Asset Transfer where a
customer asks to transfer funds to a blockchain address. It misses information
about who the beneficiary is, which has to be discovered to complete the
transaction::

```json
{
  "from": "did:web:originator.vasp",
  "type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
  "id": "...",
  "to": [
    "did:web:beneficiary.vasp",
    "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb"
  ],
  "body": {
    "@context": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0",
    "@type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
    "originator": {
      "@id": "did:eg:bob"
    },
    "asset": "eip155:1/slip44:60",
    "amountSubunits": "1230000000000000000",
    "settlementId": "eip155:1:tx/0x3edb98c24d46d148eb926c714f4fbaa117c47b0c0821f38bfce9763604457c33",
    "agents": [
      {
        "@id": "did:web:originator.vasp",
        "for": "did:eg:bob"
      },
      {
        "@id": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb",
        "role": "SettlementAddress"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Complete example showing VASP to VASP third-party Asset Transfer

After completing the discovery aspects of TAP, the Asset Transfer could look
like this with a third-party beneficiary and a VASP controlling the Settlement
Address. It now has all the required information to complete it:

```json
{
  "from": "did:web:originator.vasp",
  "type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
  "id": "...",
  "to": [
    "did:web:beneficiary.vasp",
    "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb"
  ],
  "body": {
    "@context": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0",
    "@type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
    "originator": {
      "@id": "did:eg:bob"
    },
    "beneficiary": {
      "@id": "did:eg:alice"
    },
    "asset": "eip155:1/slip44:60",
    "amountSubunits": "1230000000000000000",
    "settlementId": "eip155:1:tx/0x3edb98c24d46d148eb926c714f4fbaa117c47b0c0821f38bfce9763604457c33",
    "agents": [
      {
        "@id": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0xabcda96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb",
        "for": "did:web:originator.vasp",
        "role": "SourceAddress"
      },
      {
        "@id": "did:web:originator.vasp",
        "for": "did:eg:bob"
      },
      {
        "@id": "did:web:beneficiary.vasp",
        "for": "did:eg:alice"
      },
      {
        "@id": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb",
        "for": "did:web:beneficiary.vasp",
        "role": "SettlementAddress"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Complete example showing VASP to first-party self-hosted wallet Asset Transfer

After completing the discovery aspects of TAP, we discover the Asset Transfer
goes to the customer’s self-hosted wallet address:

```json
{
  "from": "did:web:originator.vasp",
  "type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
  "id": "...",
  "to": [
    "did:web:beneficiary.vasp",
    "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb"
  ],
  "body": {
    "@context": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0",
    "@type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
    "originator": {
      "@id": "did:eg:bob"
    },
    "beneficiary": {
      "@id": "did:eg:bob"
    },
    "asset": "eip155:1/slip44:60",
    "amountSubunits": "1230000000000000000",
    "settlementId": "eip155:1:tx/0x3edb98c24d46d148eb926c714f4fbaa117c47b0c0821f38bfce9763604457c33",
    "agents": [
      {
        "@id": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0xabcda96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb",
        "for": "did:web:originator.vasp",
        "role": "SourceAddress"
      },
      {
        "@id": "did:web:originator.vasp",
        "for": "did:eg:bob"
      },
      {
        "@id": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb",
        "for": "did:eg:bob",
        "role": "SettlementAddress"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Party specific messages

The following are example plaintext messages. See [TAIP-2] for how to sign the
messages.

#### UpdateParty example

```json
{
  "from": "did:web:beneficiary.vasp",
  "type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#AddAgents",
  "thid": "ID of transfer request",
  "to": ["did:web:originator.vasp"],
  "body": {
    "@context": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0",
    "@type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#UpdateParty",
    "partyType": "beneficiary",
    "party": {
      "@context": { "iso": "https://schema.org/addressCountry" },
      "@id": "did:eg:bob",
      "iso:addressCountry": "de"
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

<!--Please add an explicit list of intra-actor assumptions and known risk factors if applicable. Any normative definition of an interface requires these to be implementable; assumptions and risks should be at both individual interaction/use-case scale and systemically, should the interface specified gain ecosystem-namespace adoption. -->

As in any decentralized messaging protocol, it is paramount that the recipient
of messages trust the senders in the context of a particular transaction.

TODO specify in more detail.

## Privacy Considerations

<!--Please add an explicit list of intra-actor assumptions and known risk factors if applicable. Any normative definition of an interface requires these to be implementable; assumptions and risks should be at both individual interaction/use-case scale and systemically, should the interface specified gain ecosystem-namespace adoption. -->

Parties represent real-world entities, both natural and legal persons. For this
reason, it is essential to take privacy concerns very seriously. [TAIP-2]
supports encrypted messages, and the message content can be end-to-end
encrypted. Not all recipients need access to the PII of an ultimate party to a
transaction.

We are proposing a privacy-preserving Selective Disclosure scheme in [TAIP-8]
designed to minimize the exposure of PII to a minimum and also consider the
managing process of requesting and responding to required PII.

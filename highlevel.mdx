# Executive Summary: Transaction Authorization Protocol (TAP)

**Overview:** The Transaction Authorization Protocol (TAP) is a new open standard that adds a secure authorization layer to blockchain transactions. It is *“crypto’s first private decentralized payment messaging protocol for VASPs, financial institutions, DeFi, and self-hosted wallets”* ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=Real)). In essence, TAP allows multiple participants in a transaction (such as sending and receiving banks, crypto exchanges, or wallets) to identify each other and *collaborate on authorizing or rejecting a transfer* before it is finalized on a blockchain ([Transaction Authorization Protocol (TAP) · GitHub](https://github.com/TransactionAuthorizationProtocol#:~:text=Transaction%20Authorization%20Protocol%20)) ([Transaction Authorization Protocol](https://tap.rsvp/TAIPs/taip-4#:~:text=Simple%20Summary)). By enabling this off-chain coordination, TAP bridges the trust gap in crypto payments and brings the reliability of traditional payment networks to blockchain-based transactions ([Transaction Authorization Protocol](https://tap.rsvp/TAIPs/taip-4#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20it%20presents%20businesses%20and,permissionless%20aspects%20of%20blockchains%20today)). This means organizations can execute cryptocurrency payments with greater confidence, knowing that all parties have agreed to the transaction details, compliance checks, and security measures in advance.

**Key Benefits of TAP:**
- **Regulatory Compliance (Travel Rule):** TAP is designed to help companies *“comply with… FATF’s Travel Rule, and other regulations without compromising user privacy”* ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=Comply%20with%20latest%20regulations%20Comply,regulations%20without%20compromising%20user%20privacy)). Sender and receiver institutions can privately exchange required customer information and approvals before a crypto transfer, meeting AML requirements while keeping personal data off the public blockchain. This built-in compliance mechanism simplifies adhering to global regulations for virtual asset transfers.
- **Prevents Errors & Loss of Funds:** By introducing a two-way authorization handshake, TAP ensures transactions *arrive at the correct destination without loss or theft of funds* ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=Avoid%20loss%20of%20customer%20funds,loss%20or%20theft%20of%20funds)). Both the originator and beneficiary (or their agents) must confirm details before on-chain settlement. This multi-party verification dramatically reduces mistakes like sending to the wrong address or unsupported blockchain, since issues are caught and resolved in the authorization phase rather than after the fact.
- **Enhanced Security & Trust:** TAP brings an unprecedented security improvement: for the first time, a beneficiary can approve or reject an incoming crypto payment **before** it happens. For example, a recipient’s institution can withhold providing a deposit address until all risk checks pass, effectively blocking unauthorized or suspicious transfers ([Transaction Authorization Protocol](https://tap.rsvp/TAIPs/taip-4#:~:text=By%20not%20providing%20a%20,transactions%20for%20the%20first%20time)) ([Transaction Authorization Protocol](https://tap.rsvp/TAIPs/taip-4#:~:text=TAP%20proposes%20a%20non,agents%20have%20mitigated%20sufficient%20risk)). All parties gain confidence that a transaction is legitimate and wanted. The protocol also replaces the reliance on long, opaque blockchain addresses with recognized identifiers, so users transact with known counterparties instead of random strings ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=Better%20and%20more%20secure%20user,world%20counterparts)). This greatly *improves the user experience by replacing confusing blockchain addresses with real-world counterparts* ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=Better%20and%20more%20secure%20user,world%20counterparts)), reducing human error and building trust between transacting parties.
- **Streamlined Payment Workflows:** With TAP, blockchain payments can mirror the structured workflows of traditional finance. It enables *“transactions between people rather than cryptographic addresses” by securely linking real-world identities to blockchain transactions* ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=Transactions%20between%20people%20rather%20than,cryptographic%20addresses)). Businesses can attach invoices, reference numbers, or messages to a payment, and institutions can require certain steps (like KYC verification) before execution. This means crypto payments can fit seamlessly into business processes – from accounting and record-keeping to trade settlement – rather than being isolated technical events. By aligning on-chain transfers with off-chain documentation and approvals, TAP makes reconciliation and post-transaction processing much easier ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=Reconciliation%20with%20real,fulfillment%2C%20and%20regulatory%20compliance%20purposes)).
- **Open and Interoperable:** TAP is an open, public-domain protocol with no proprietary gatekeepers or licensing restrictions ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=No%20gatekeepers%2C%20no%20restrictions%2C%20no,limits)). It’s designed for industry-wide adoption and innovation. Any exchange, bank, or wallet provider can implement TAP and even suggest improvements to the standard. This open approach encourages interoperability: a payment initiated by one institution’s system can be authorized by another’s, as long as both use TAP. The result is a more connected ecosystem of blockchain payments, where participants speak a common language for authorizations and compliance.

## Improving Blockchain Transactions with TAP

Blockchain transactions today are fast and irreversible, but they lack the safety nets of traditional payments. In conventional banking, both sender and receiver (and their banks) verify payment details, and there are mechanisms to cancel or flag issues before settlement. Crypto transactions, by contrast, have relied solely on the sender’s action (the private key holder authorizing the transfer) with no built-in confirmation from the beneficiary’s side ([Transaction Authorization Protocol](https://tap.rsvp/TAIPs/taip-4#:~:text=Currently%2C%20crypto%20transactions%20are%20limited,mechanisms%20for%20authorization%20by%20beneficiaries)) ([Transaction Authorization Protocol](https://tap.rsvp/TAIPs/taip-4#:~:text=Once%20a%20transaction%20is%20authorized,authorizations%20from%20the%20underlying%20settlement)). Once a transaction is broadcast, it cannot be reversed ([Transaction Authorization Protocol](https://tap.rsvp/TAIPs/taip-4#:~:text=Once%20a%20transaction%20is%20authorized,authorizations%20from%20the%20underlying%20settlement)). This gap leads to operational risks – funds can be mis-sent or refused with no recourse, and compliance checks are often bolted on awkwardly outside the blockchain.

TAP addresses these challenges by separating **transaction authorization** from on-chain **settlement**. It introduces an off-chain messaging exchange (the “authorization layer”) that runs **before** or alongside the blockchain transfer (the “settlement layer”) ([Transaction Authorization Protocol](https://tap.rsvp/TAIPs/taip-4#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20it%20presents%20businesses%20and,permissionless%20aspects%20of%20blockchains%20today)). Through this protocol, an originating party’s agent (e.g. a crypto exchange or bank) and a beneficiary’s agent can coordinate in real time: the originator sends a transaction request, and the beneficiary (and even other intermediaries, if involved) can respond with approvals, information requests, or rejections. Only when all parties are satisfied – each having negotiated for the information or assurances they require – will the transaction move to the blockchain for final settlement ([Transaction Authorization Protocol](https://tap.rsvp/TAIPs/taip-4#:~:text=TAP%20proposes%20a%20non,agents%20have%20mitigated%20sufficient%20risk)). If requirements aren’t met, the transaction can be halted *before any funds move*, avoiding failures or losses. This collaborative authorization flow is flexible rather than one-size-fits-all, so it can accommodate simple two-party transfers or more complex multi-party transactions with the same protocol ([Transaction Authorization Protocol](https://tap.rsvp/TAIPs/taip-4#:~:text=Most%20protocols%20implementing%20the%20FATF,authorization%20flow%20of%20a%20transaction)) ([Transaction Authorization Protocol](https://tap.rsvp/TAIPs/taip-4#:~:text=TAP%20proposes%20a%20non,agents%20have%20mitigated%20sufficient%20risk)). The end result is a blockchain payment process that is much more robust and business-friendly, without sacrificing the decentralization and finality that make blockchains powerful.

## Enhancing Compliance and Security

**Travel Rule Compliance:** Financial regulators worldwide (guided by FATF’s Travel Rule) now require that when cryptocurrency transactions exceed certain thresholds, the institutions involved must exchange identifying information about the sender and receiver. TAP streamlines this requirement by making the exchange of such *“Travel Rule information”* a native part of the transaction workflow ([Notabene, M2 and Mastercard Partner to Simplify Compliance and Increase Consumer Trust with Crypto Credential Integration | Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250213266435/en/Notabene-M2-and-Mastercard-Partner-to-Simplify-Compliance-and-Increase-Consumer-Trust-with-Crypto-Credential-Integration#:~:text=empowers%20people%20to%20enjoy%20peace,metadata%20and%20Travel%20Rule%20information)). For instance, when a customer at Exchange A wants to send crypto to a user at Exchange B, the two exchanges can use TAP to automatically swap the necessary customer data and sanctions screening results in a secure message, before any crypto is sent. This occurs privately between the exchanges’ systems, so personal data is not written to any public ledger ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=Comply%20with%20latest%20regulations%20Comply,regulations%20without%20compromising%20user%20privacy)). Each party can confirm that the other has received and verified the information, ensuring **compliance is in place upfront**. By automating compliance checks in this way, TAP reduces manual overhead and errors, and increases the success rate of lawful transactions (historically, many transfers have failed or been delayed due to missing Travel Rule info in rigid two-party processes ([Transaction Authorization Protocol](https://tap.rsvp/TAIPs/taip-4#:~:text=Most%20protocols%20implementing%20the%20FATF,authorization%20flow%20of%20a%20transaction))). TAP’s flexible negotiation means even if multiple institutions or steps are involved, all needed compliance approvals can be obtained in one coherent flow. This gives regulators and businesses confidence that crypto transfers won’t bypass required controls – they’re handled as responsibly as a bank wire, only faster.

**Security and Fraud Prevention:** Beyond compliance, TAP significantly boosts the security of crypto payments. It provides a communication channel for sharing risk signals or validations. For example, a receiving bank can use TAP to confirm the **correct wallet address and asset type** with the sender before anything is sent, eliminating the chance of depositing to an incompatible address or the wrong blockchain. Likewise, the sender can be assured the beneficiary’s account is ready and expecting the funds. If something seems amiss – say the names or account details don’t match, or the receiving party has flagged risk – either side can pause or reject the transaction *in advance*. As noted, **recipients are no longer passive**: a beneficiary agent can refuse to provide a deposit address or explicitly send a rejection message, effectively stopping an unwanted transaction ([Transaction Authorization Protocol](https://tap.rsvp/TAIPs/taip-4#:~:text=By%20not%20providing%20a%20,transactions%20for%20the%20first%20time)). This opt-in nature means funds won’t blindly arrive where they shouldn’t, which is a major shift from today’s push-only crypto model. All TAP messages are encrypted and direct between the parties, preserving confidentiality while enabling crucial data exchange ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=Comply%20with%20latest%20regulations%20Comply,regulations%20without%20compromising%20user%20privacy)). By *“dramatically improving the safety and security of… on-chain transactions”* ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=Safer%20withdrawals%20and%20deposits%20Dramatically,chain%20transactions)), TAP helps institutions prevent fraud, avoid sending funds into black holes, and protect customers from errors or malicious activities. It builds a layer of **trust** on top of trustless blockchains – participants can verify each other and the transaction details, making blockchain payments as secure and predictable as traditional electronic payments.

## Impact on Financial Institutions, Exchanges, and Businesses

TAP’s introduction stands to benefit a range of stakeholders in the blockchain payment ecosystem:

- **Financial Institutions:** Banks and payment companies exploring digital assets can use TAP to **safely integrate blockchain transactions** into their services. The protocol ensures that crypto transfers meet the same standards as SWIFT or ACH transfers – complete with sender/receiver identification, confirmations, and audit trails – before the crypto moves. This reduces the risk profile of handling cryptocurrencies and addresses key concerns around compliance and control. For example, a bank can require that any stablecoin payment coming from a customer is approved by the recipient’s bank via TAP, so both sides have recorded KYC data and agreed on the purpose of the payment. Such features make it easier for traditional institutions to embrace blockchain-based payments, from interbank settlements to customer remittances, because TAP *“securely and privately connect[s] the real-world identities of… customers and counterparties to blockchain transactions”* ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=Transactions%20between%20people%20rather%20than,cryptographic%20addresses)). The result is improved trust and transparency — banks can treat a crypto transaction with the same confidence as a wire transfer, knowing who is on the other end and that the transaction is authorized by all parties.

- **Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Custodians:** For crypto exchanges, custodial wallets, and other Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), TAP streamlines regulatory compliance and improves user experience. Exchanges are on the front lines of Travel Rule enforcement; with TAP, much of this process can be automated and standardized across the industry. When an exchange user withdraws crypto to another platform or wallet, the sending exchange can initiate a TAP request that conveys the necessary compliance info and waits for the receiving side’s authorization. This ensures the receiving exchange or custodian has acknowledged the transaction (and collected any required user info) before funds are sent, greatly reducing failed deposits or tickets to customer support. It also gives exchanges a tool to **prevent misdirected withdrawals** – if a user mistakenly initiates a transfer to an address not associated with the intended recipient, the TAP flow can catch the error and halt the transfer. By using *multi-party authorization* instead of today’s unilateral sends, exchanges can offer customers safer deposits and withdrawals, where *funds “arrive at the correct destination” with no losses* ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=Avoid%20loss%20of%20customer%20funds,loss%20or%20theft%20of%20funds)). This builds trust in the exchange’s reliability. Moreover, TAP can facilitate faster listings and integrations between exchanges: when both sides support TAP, transferring assets between platforms becomes as seamless as an automated bank transfer, with all compliance checks handled in the messaging layer. Overall, TAP helps exchanges and other VASPs reduce compliance friction, avoid costly mistakes, and provide a smoother cross-platform transaction experience for users.

- **Businesses Using Blockchain Payments:** Companies ranging from e-commerce merchants to large enterprises are beginning to use cryptocurrency (especially stablecoins) for payments to suppliers, employees, or online customers. TAP directly enables these business transactions to be *safe, private, and well-documented*. For instance, an online **merchant** can send a payment request via TAP that includes the invoice details and customer information needed to fulfill an order, while the customer’s wallet or exchange shares the payment confirmation and shipping info securely. This fulfills the same role as a payment gateway in traditional e-commerce, but without exposing personal data on-chain – TAP *“securely and privately share[s] merchant, invoice, and customer information to safely enable e-commerce payments using stablecoins”* ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=E,commerce%20payments%20using%20stablecoins)). In a B2B scenario, a company can pay an overseas vendor in cryptocurrency and attach the invoice number, amount, and beneficiary identity in the TAP message. The vendor’s bank or wallet provider will authorize and provide the correct receiving address once everything checks out, ensuring the cross-border payment is *“tied to… customers, suppliers, and invoices, not [just] opaque blockchain addresses”* ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=B2B%20Payments%20Instantly%20settled%20cross,invoices%20not%20opaque%20blockchain%20addresses)). This makes accounting and compliance far easier – both sides have a record of who and what the payment was for, akin to a SWIFT message, but with near-instant blockchain settlement. Additionally, TAP can integrate with corporate treasury controls: a CFO or compliance officer could be an approving party in the TAP flow for large transactions, adding oversight before funds move. For any business using crypto, TAP reduces the technical complexity and risk, allowing them to focus on the commercial value. It provides peace of mind that payments will go to the right place with all necessary information attached, which is critical for broader enterprise adoption of blockchain payments.

## Real-World Use Cases

To illustrate how TAP works in practice, here are a few examples of its potential application in payments and compliance:

- **Instant Cross-Border Payment:** A fintech firm in the U.S. needs to send a $100,000 stablecoin payment to a partner company in Europe. Using TAP, the firm’s wallet platform sends a transaction proposal to the partner’s bank. They exchange required details (company identities, compliance references, and the intended blockchain address) through secure TAP messages. Both sides authorize the transaction, and only then are the stablecoins released on-chain. The payment arrives within minutes, and because the transfer was pre-approved with all information, it meets regulatory requirements and is immediately reconciled in both companies’ books. This scenario shows how **B2B payments can be instantly settled across borders with the context (who, what for) intact**, instead of just sending tokens to a random address ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=B2B%20Payments%20Instantly%20settled%20cross,invoices%20not%20opaque%20blockchain%20addresses)).

- **Exchange-to-Exchange Crypto Transfer:** A customer wants to move crypto from Exchange A to Exchange B. Normally, the user would withdraw to an address and hope everything matches up. With TAP, Exchange A initiates a request to Exchange B’s TAP endpoint including the customer’s identity (as needed for compliance) and transaction details. Exchange B responds with an authorization and provides a deposit address tied to the user’s account. Exchange A now confidently settles the transaction on-chain to that address. The result is a **frictionless transfer between exchanges**: the user didn’t have to copy an address, both exchanges exchanged Travel Rule data automatically, and the funds were not sent until the receiving side confirmed readiness. This greatly increases success rates of crypto transfers between platforms. If something were wrong (e.g., the user’s name on the two exchanges didn’t match, or the asset isn’t supported), the transaction would simply not authorize, protecting all parties. In short, TAP makes inter-exchange transfers as straightforward as bank transfers, *improving “the safety and security of… on-chain transactions” like withdrawals and deposits* ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=Safer%20withdrawals%20and%20deposits%20Dramatically,chain%20transactions)).

- **E-Commerce Checkout with Stablecoins:** An online retailer offers customers the option to pay in USD Coin (USDC) for a purchase. When a customer chooses this option, the retailer’s payment system uses TAP to send a payment request to the customer’s crypto wallet app. The request includes the order amount in USDC and an order invoice ID, and it asks for the customer’s shipping details. The customer’s wallet (or exchange account) receives this request, displays the transaction details in plain language (retailer name, amount, order #, etc.), and the customer approves it. Through TAP, the wallet then sends an authorization message back with the requested info (e.g. their name and shipping address encrypted for the merchant) and a confirmation that the USDC payment can be made. The merchant’s system, upon receiving this, triggers the on-chain USDC transfer. Within seconds, the retailer has the funds and the necessary order info. The buyer did not have to manually enter an address or worry about copying the wrong amount, and the seller got the assurance of a verified payment **with all relevant metadata**. This use case demonstrates how TAP can enable **secure, private stablecoin payments for e-commerce**, marrying the speed of crypto with the data-rich workflows of traditional online payments ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=E,commerce%20payments%20using%20stablecoins)). Both customer and merchant enjoy a smooth experience, and sensitive personal data is exchanged only between them, not publicly.

## Conclusion and Key Insights

The Transaction Authorization Protocol is a powerful innovation to make blockchain payments work **for businesses and institutions at scale**. By introducing a cooperative authorization step before irreversible blockchain settlement, TAP effectively brings the best of both worlds together: the speed and finality of decentralized networks, and the oversight, compliance, and error-prevention of traditional finance. This protocol enhances payment workflows by ensuring every transaction is validated by all relevant parties, thus minimizing operational risks and building mutual trust ([Transaction Authorization Protocol (TAP) · GitHub](https://github.com/TransactionAuthorizationProtocol#:~:text=Transaction%20Authorization%20Protocol%20)). It boosts compliance by seamlessly incorporating regulations like the Travel Rule into the transaction process ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=Comply%20with%20latest%20regulations%20Comply,regulations%20without%20compromising%20user%20privacy)), and it strengthens security by giving participants tools to verify identities and addresses, preventing misfires and fraud ([TAP - The Transaction Authorization Protocol for public blockchains](https://tap.rsvp/#:~:text=Avoid%20loss%20of%20customer%20funds,loss%20or%20theft%20of%20funds)) ([Transaction Authorization Protocol](https://tap.rsvp/TAIPs/taip-4#:~:text=By%20not%20providing%20a%20,transactions%20for%20the%20first%20time)). For financial institutions, crypto exchanges, and businesses, TAP opens the door to wider adoption of crypto payments – transactions can now be as **safe, compliant, and user-friendly** as any bank transfer or card payment, if not more so. Executives and decision-makers should view TAP as an enabling layer that can accelerate innovation in payments: it reduces the hidden frictions of crypto transactions, making them **practical for real-world use cases** from cross-border settlements to everyday commerce. In summary, TAP improves the efficiency and trustworthiness of blockchain transactions, providing a clear path for organizations to harness blockchain technology for payments while meeting their security and regulatory needs. This collaborative protocol represents a significant step toward mainstreaming digital assets in the global financial system, turning blockchain’s promise of fast, borderless payments into a business reality – with compliance and peace of mind built in.
